Formula to calculate BMI
BMI = Weight / Height * Height
The body mass index allows you to know if the weight is adapted to the height, if the member is overweight, obese, or on the contrary too thin. Validated by the WHO, this index is reliable for adults, men and women, between 18 and 65 years old.

Definition of BMI
Body mass index (BMI) is used to estimate weight distribution by height. Its calculation is simple: it corresponds to the weight divided by the square of the height. The figure obtained makes it possible to estimate corpulence and possibly overweight or obesity in adults.
Interpretation of the Body Mass Index
A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25.
Below 18.5, the individual is considered too thin.
Above 25 is overweight. From 30, we speak of obesity.
BMI < 18.5 kg/m²: underweight
18.5 < BMI < 24.9: normal weight
25 < BMI < 29.9: overweight
BMI > 30: obesity
For a BMI equal to or greater than 25kg/m² and less than 35kg/m², the clinical examination must be completed by measuring the waist circumference
